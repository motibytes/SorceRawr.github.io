# What is SorceRawr?

SorceRawr.com is the future 'Source of Creativity',
rapidly rising as the definitive creativity cultivation site on the net.

That is to say, its intention is directed at becoming the world's greatest source
for inspiration and creative access and tools, with. No. Filler.

What that means to say is that this website aims to provide __the care package__
future aspiring artists are searching for, the teachings that will lead them to thrive.

This website is a gift basket to the world, and a gift to my younger creative self,
who did not find these resources.

This site will never be overloaded with content. As of the time of this writing, SorceRawr contains less than 20 main pages. As the amount of content scales, all personal projects I show on the site will be moved to one page. This is not a _blog_ or a news outlet in the sense that the information here aims to be timeless resources.

As I reflect on the current content of the site, whatever is determined not to be critical information will eventually be removed.

Inspired by anything on the site? Want to show some appreciation?

Interested in investing in the sites potential to become the __ultimate free resource for future creatives__?
