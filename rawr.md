# What is SorceRawr?

Sorcerawr.com's Intention is directed at becoming the world's definitive source
for inspiration and creative access and tools.

This site is a gift basket to the world, and a gift to my younger creative self,
who did not find these resources.

<!--
With. No. Filler.

SorceRawr.com is the future 'Source of Creativity',
rapidly rising as the definitive creativity cultivation site on the net.

This website aims to provide __the care package__
future aspiring artists are searching for, the teachings that will lead them to thrive.

This site will never be overloaded with content. As I reflect on the current content of the site, whatever is determined not to be critical information will eventually be removed.
<!-- As of the time of this writing, SorceRawr contains less than 20 main pages. As the amount of content scales, all personal projects I show on the site will be moved to one page. This is not a _blog_ or a news outlet in the sense that the information here aims to be timeless resources.
Inspired by anything on the site? Want to show some appreciation?
