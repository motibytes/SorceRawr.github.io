'''And put your feet into her fetters and your neck into her collar. Bow your shoulder down and bear her, and do not be irritated by her chains.
Draw near to her with all your soul, and keep her ways with all of your power.
Search out and seek her, and she will become known to you; and when possession takes place, do not let her go.
For you will at last find her rest, and it will be turned into joy for you.
And her fetters will be a mighty protection for you, and her branches a garment of glory.
For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her chains are purple thread.
You will put her on as a garment of glory, you will place a crown of joy upon yourself.
