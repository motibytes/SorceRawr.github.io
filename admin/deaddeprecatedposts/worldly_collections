# Happiness Project 1 :

-


I had everything I could possibly want, yet I was failing to appreciate it. I too often failed to comprehend the splendor of what I had.
Colette: 'What a wonderful life I've had! I only wish I'd realized it sooner."

How could I set a higher standard for myself as a wife, a mother, a writer, a friend? How could I let go of everyday annoyances to keep a larger, more transcendent perspective?

#Dickinson:

Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed -
I hope the "Children" there
Won't be "new fashioned" when I come -
And laugh at me - and stare -

I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl -
Old fashioned - naughty - everything
Over the stile of "Pearl."

# Gilbert:

-

You do not need a permission slip from the principal's office to live a creative life.
Or if you do worry that you need a permission slip---
THERE, I just gave it to you.

I just wrote it on the back of an old shopping list.

Consider yourself fully accredited.

Now go make something.

Paradox, It matters./It doesn't matter.
Build space in your head for this paradox

"My creative expression must be the most important thing in the world to me (if I am to live artistically), and it also must not matter to me at all (if I am to live sanely)"

'It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer too'

What a wonderful life I've had. I only wish I'd realized it sooner.

# Dickinson

"If pain for peace prepares
Lo, what "Augustan" years
Can the Anemones
Be reckoned up?

If night stands first - then noon
To gird us for the sun,
What gaze!

When from a thousand skies
On our developed eyes
Noons blaze! "

# Owning Your Own Shadow -

-'Beauty (or worth) is in the eyes of the beholder'

Gold in the Shadow:
There are two shadows: 1 the dark side of the ego, which is carefully hidden from itself and which
the ego will not acknowledge unless forced to by life's difficulties, and (2) that which has been
repressed in us lest it interfere with our egocentricity and, however devilish it may seem, is basically
connected to the Self.
In a showdown God (Self) favors the shadow over the ego, for the shadow, with all of its dangerousness,
is closer to the center and more genuine.
-


- people are as frightened of their capacity for nobility as of their darkest sides.
If you find the gold in someone who will resist it to the last ounce of his strength.
This is why we engage in hero-worship so often.

our hero worshipping capacity is pure shadow, our finest qualities are refused and laid on another
todays hero is tomorrows character
-

as the shadow is drawn up into consciousness, it becomes softer, more pliable, more gentle.
..neither ego nor shadow can be redeemed unless its twin is transformed..
rubbing together..this is nothing less than healing the split between heaven and hell.
-
'If we can learn to love the inner enemy, then there is a chance of loving - and redeeming - the outer one '
-
"when we can face our inner heaven and our inner hell, this is the highest form of creativity"
-
to be in the presence of another's shadow and not reply is nothing short of genius.
No one has the right to dump his shadow on you, and you have the right to self protection.
-
most people have to work very hard to throw off their parent's shadow
If a parent lays his shadow on a young child, that splits the personality of the child
and sets the ego-shadow warfare into motion. When that child grows up, he will have a large shadow to cope with
and also have the tendency to put that shadow upon his own children.
-
'..acts will have an equal weight on opposite side of scale...
we can be aware of this dynamic and make a conscious gesture to compensate for it..'

-
the unconscious cannot tell the difference between a 'real' act and a symbolic one
[which means we can pay out that darkness in a symbolic way
short story or active imagination mentioned, mentions another book he wrote,
Inner Work: Using Dreams and Active Imagination for Personal Growth.]
-
Had any terrible successes lately?
-
there is a broader sense of creativity that folds the darkness into the finished
product and finds fulfillment in the shadow. This is pure genius. Its attributes
are wholeness, health, and holyness,
and saintness in the original meaning of the word, a full embracing of humanity.

-
the more refined our conscious personality, the more shadow we have built
up on the other side.
jung's insight, the ego and shadow come from the same source and exactly balance each other.
To make light is to make shadow; one cannot exist without the other.

to own one's shadow is to reach an holy place- an inner center--

# Century of the Self

Bernes made up his own title..field..idea..
'public relations'

# Sirach

the wise in word will make himself beloved

the heart of the stupid is in their mouth, but the mouth of the wise is in their heart.

and he put his eye upon their hearts
to show them the splendor of his works..

# Poetry site

-

 “Poetry redeems from decay the visitations of the divinity in man.” The poem is a genie that comes out of the bottle to liberate the reader’s imagination, the divinity within.
  The writer and the reader make meaning together. The poet who calls on help from the heavenly muse also does so on behalf of the imaginative reader.

-


[W.S. Merwin, for example, remembers his teacher John Berryman giving him advice in the years just after the Second World War:]

he suggested I pray to the Muse
get down on my knees and pray
right there in the corner and he
said he meant it literally
[Berryman also said that]

the great presence
that permitted everything and transmuted it
in poetry was passion
passion was genius and he praised movement and invention

# Tara

when you see them in their inner beauty and goodness you transform and create.

whats standing between me and my own goodness?

protecting my purity for years like the buddha statue covered in clay..

see how much they must be judging themselves, how sad

# Ayla

to ayla "wow. week 4 really showed a mastery of your philosophy, understanding, focus in life."

try on different things, take on a different self
take on another essence, or like an accent, pretend

culture of dampening our light
culture that says we arent supposed to be in a state of wonder at all times,
at the magnificence of whats going on around us
and to be in a state of wonder about our emotions
and about the parts of our planet that also need healing
 doesnt want us to stay in a state of wonder,
there is power in our wonder
there is power in our innocent eyes looking up and being curious
there is power in wondering in awe at pain and destruction
when we approach these things that might be challenging, we approach with curiosity and wonder
it changes how we talk about it, how we understand it, how a creation will be about it
to put on a different lens that is very curious about life and looking at the details and wanting to understand more
about why things are the way it is and
how do things feel like and come up new words and plant these seeds that create flowers of detail and bring us into
a new environment, a place we want to bring people.

we inspire change by touching on the awe of the thing we want to observe. when we exalt and praise what is necessary
and essential for life, we bring others into our world, and we give them a pair of binoculars to look at the marvelous things
that we're seeing,
how can you not want to protect the planet when you see how amazing it is?
how can you not want to protect a forest when it brings you into a feeling or makes

use detail to bring each other into a world a whole universe we are creating

creating more experiences in life and in your self where we are open.
-
wrap our shame in a hug, wrap the whole experience in a hug, our energetic embrace, accept it, love ourselves with whatevers going on in there
dropping the resistance, loving myself just as i am for everything im feeling right now
sing to the shame,
or ask it what its afraid of, what it needs
-
in many traditions, it is no longer a gift if you record it, to where you were intending it.
so when you record it, it freezes it.
and thats why a lot of the old spells were not recorded.

magic barrier -
take a few deep breaths
feel into your energy field
you can tune into how close or far it is, right near your skin or very far away,
parts of it might be in the past or future
don't really have to even do anything, intend that your energy body comes to about 4 feet of you.

play with it, moving it out and in until you move it about 4-5ish feet from your body
and with your breath you're going to feel into your heart first, tune into the radiance of your heart,
like a lightbulb inside your heart
and you're going to feel that light fill through every cell in your body through all of your atoms,
expanding with your breath
might feel tingly, or soft
and just expand that light outside your skin, farther farther, until it is permeating that whole energy field
around you.
And just take a few deep breaths charging it up, with more light, or love,
however it feels right to you
and you're going to just feel how that light and that love that is this vital energy
and you're just going to send beams of love into your cells into your body into your throat
into all the chakras your organs every cell every single cell
sending all your love and gratitude
and then still feeling that energy radiating in you, you can start to beam, it might already be beaming
but feel the beam, feel the emanation that's coming from you,
light emitted from your being, so you're a beacon,
that love, that love, that vital force is a beacon
and you can keep that, keep that feeling, you can open your eyes but keep that feeling, awareness
and you can keep that kind of radiant emanation energy
and you can turn into actually how its impossible when we're emanating this much light and love, it's impossible
for anything that is not love, that is not benevolent, to enter our field, because we are emanating that,
it can't go opposite, it's too strong.
I've found that this is a helpful way of making my field strong, and having a boundary without it actually being a wall,
rather it's a resonant field,
and anything that is not in resonance with my field cannot enter. it just wont. it cant. it's impossible.

For me, there's also techniques you can learn to create an energetic shield around yourself and those can be helpful
too... but i've found it's actually more powerful for me to resonate and emanate into my field and nothing can enter
that's not in alignment with that.

so can help us remember that we're energetic beings, and actually creators, creators of  reality,
not just remembering how to create art, remembering how to be creators of our reality, every moment.

..send a tone, an offering to the world from the radiance of your being,
so you're gonna let your beacon shine really strong right now through your voice, as a vibration,
in this vibrational reality and you're going to send it out.

warrior...to be a pillar means we're going to be resonating with a frequency that's going to be beneficial
to everyone around us.

'if i take the time to actually imagine the whole song or the whole orchestration around one part, and then i record my voice singing it,
it encodes all of that into it, and also leads me into the next thing and things around it , the fullness, the potential around that song,
and listening, ..
imagining "what would be the most amazing song to hear right now? " as if someone else wrote it.

imitating, pretending you're an artist that you like.

'you're already trying on one personality, that's you, why not try on another and just see what happens?'

sing the shape of the sound that wants to come through, not words

outline a shape with sound practice

keep a wordbank

use resonance sound meditation

use shielding meditation

write what you see/hear/taste/feel/smell/sense.

allowing something to come through and then broadcasting  is the biggest prayer we could give to others who are afraid to
that is a prayer for everyone to allow more of themselves to come through.
so give yourself that much permission.
prayer for others is much bigger than small fear of being heart for me
(and part of the prayer is that they DO hear you, they hear your imperfection, )

"to be love, to be an embodiment of love on this planet"
"we are love, so then we allow ourselves to be expressions of love every moment"
"if you want to know how to open your creative channel, try being an embodiment of love every moment, there's nothing like that to open all the channels"

reengage with old content for 5 mins

write things that describe what you're thinking about, instead of, "letting go", writing things that describe that. instead of pain, things that describe that

sing to the stuckness itself

have non-limiting identification ( what i do does not limit me )

if i'm not separate from existence, then what do I have to be afraid of?


vessel of whatever form of creativity wants to come through,
its our job to catch, to always be ready to catch.
-
So instead of getting to Heaven, at last —
I’m going, all along.

soak in the gift of space

- Writing Practice 2: Do the practice above, but start with the phrase "I am..." Don't let the pen stop. Whenever you get caught in thinking, start the sentence over. Can also try "We are.." or "This is..."

- Writing Practice 3: Write for 2 minutes,
“what do I want so deeply, but also scares me to try?” OR
“What am I holding back from, because I’m afraid to _____(fail / succeed / be ridiculed...)?”

- Writing Practice 4: -
Now, feel into those voices from practice 3.
See if they’re trying to protect you,
or prove something... write for 2 minutes from their voices,
about why they’re in your head and how they’re trying to help you.

# Dickinson:

I died for beauty, but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.

He questioned softly why I failed?
“For beauty,” I replied.
“And I for truth, —the two are one;
We brethren are,” he said.

And so, as kinsmen met a night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names.

"Mastering fear doesn't mean getting rid of the butterflies in your stomach. It means teaching them to fly in formation."

 This is It

# Brene Brown:

courage from latin cour "to speak one's mind by telling all one's heart"

the courage to be imperfect
the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others
we can't show compassion to other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly

they had connection as a result of authenticity

they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be
in order to be who they were

they fully embraced vulnerability
they believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful

# Occult:


"I have personal knowledge of more than twenty-five instances where the performance of [Enochian] magical
operations based upon the Order's [i.e. Alpha et Omega's] formulae led to serious disintegrations of mind and body...
 Perhaps the most conspicuous example of the use of these formulas is A.C. [Aleister Crowley] himself,
 but there are plenty of others I have personally witnessed,
 whose personal shipwrecks have been just as complete even though their smaller tonnage,
 so to say, makes the loss seem less deplorable..."[15]

# Alchemist:

that's what alchemists do. they show that, when we strive to be better than we are,
everything around us becomes better, too.

It is we who nourish the Soul of the World,

Because when we love, we always strive to become better than we are.
