make the about page for google indexing



Final thoughts
When I started writing this article, Ahrefs didn’t have a Knowledge Panel. But we do now, thanks to the tips I explained above.

What seemed to have the most significant impact was creating a proper Wikidata page,
which we also linked in our Organization markup using the sameAs property.
Our Wikidata page got indexed the same day we updated the Organization schema,
and it took around a week before we saw the Knowledge Panel show up.

Even though we lost both the Wikidata and Wikipedia pages, the Knowledge Panel remained.
It lost some attributes but as you should already know, there are other ways to build your entity besides Wiki.

Our experience aside, knowledge graphs and entities have been with us for quite some time already,
and they will only become more and more important. Google is already on its way to “entity-first indexing,”
so understanding these topics is crucial in today’s SEO.

If you have any questions or remarks about this fascinating topic, feel free to ping me on Twitter.
