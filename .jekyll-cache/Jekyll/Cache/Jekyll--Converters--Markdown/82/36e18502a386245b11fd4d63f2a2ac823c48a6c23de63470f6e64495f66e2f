<p>You may have never considered or even fathomed the joy of throwing a few dollars into something and then watching your money violently gain and lose value, but I can tell you this edge of your seat action is possible to take part in right this very moment.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s kind of like throwing pennies into a wishing well that becomes self aware and starts throwing pennies back at you.</p>

<p>The days of staring at clouds praying for money to fall from the sky are over.</p>

<p>There is simply no better way to reflect and contemplate on the full unrealized potential of your greed and unrealized dreams than while watching your $2 worth of bitcoin multiply in abundance as you are filled with the realizations of why you arenâ€™t rich and why it really is all your fault. Bitcoin will change your life!</p>
