I"o<p>Tale of princess kaguya</p>

<p>It’s really.. really quite beautiful.. never seen anything quite like it honestly it’s kinda different</p>

<p>She like loves the humans and shit over living in perfection on the moon, shits deep</p>

<p>the art is unbelievable  it’s all watercolor. It feels less like a movie and more like a moving changing picture book</p>
