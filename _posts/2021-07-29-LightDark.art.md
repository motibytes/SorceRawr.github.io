I am interested in using a 'system of hyperlinks',
not necessarily in the sense of expressing extended meaning through the structure of the system,
[as some digital artists are aspiring towards]

but rather in using this system to create the 'illusion of magic',
that words change and transform through being interacted with,
as well as giving a subjective experience to each user.

This was the intention I put into building this unnamed piece,
which allows the user to move through words.
