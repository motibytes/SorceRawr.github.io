I am interested in using a 'system of hyperlinks'
to create the 'illusion of magic',
allowing words to change and transform through being interacted with,

from which different choices will give a different experience to each user,
as if their results were both guided and self-imposed.

This was the intention I put into building this unnamed piece,

which allows the user to move through words.
