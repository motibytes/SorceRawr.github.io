Anyone who has pursued knowledge has learned that it is the source of true power,
anyone who has sought it has learned that it will be found.

Anyone who knows of history knows that Solomon was the wealthiest who ever lived,
and anyone living knows that Jesus Christ gained the most fame.

Anyone who has found true power has found that it exists only in love, and yet
even for those that understand this, this love can be hard to find.

I have searched the esoterical texts, unsatisfied with religions, namely Christianity,
which in my youth asked me to walk like Jesus without providing the means to how.  

In my years I concluded that there is one purposeful
pursuit in this world for some few who desire it, one meaningful ancient religion.
This is a religion that has no name and is only available to those who search honestly for it.
It is the religion of the poets, the artists, the authors and the dreamers, those with hearts like David.

The religion is the falling in love with wisdom itself, as a God would love his world.
It is the pursuit of pure wisdom itself, which can be experienced as light,
the everlasting life of endless spirit that exists inside you. It is one
that the world will not hand to you, it will not agree with you and it may even turn against you.

I cannot tell you if I am right as I do not know, and I hope I am not leading you astray.
I will not persuade you to believe, I will share what I have.

What I will share with you is what I have long searched for, take this if it resonates in your
soul and never let it go.
From the Wisdom of Sirach, removed from the modern Bible, these 8 passages removed from the Greek Septuagint Bible,
only found surviving in the Catholic Douay-Rheims Bible.

Wisdom speaks and says,

24 I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope.

25 In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue.

26 Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits.

27 For my spirit is sweet above honey, and my inheritance above honey and the honeycomb.

28 My memory is unto everlasting generations.

29 They that eat me, shall yet hunger: and they that drink me, shall yet thirst.

30 He that hearkeneth to me, shall not be confounded: and they that work by me, shall not sin.

31 They that explain me shall have life everlasting.

32 All these things are the book of life, and the covenant of the most High, and the knowledge of truth.

The Full Text: [Sirach 24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Sirach%2024&version=DRA)


39 For her thoughts are more vast than the sea, and her counsels more deep than the great ocean.

40 I, wisdom, have poured out rivers.

41 I, like a brook out of a river of a mighty water; I, like a channel of a river. and like an aqueduct, came out of paradise.

42 I said: I will water my garden of plants, and I will water abundantly the fruits of my meadow.

43 And behold my brook became a great river, and my river came near to a sea:

44 For I make doctrine to shine forth to all as the morning light, and I will declare it afar off.

45 I will penetrate to all the lower parts of the earth, and will behold all that sleep, and will enlighten all that hope in the Lord.

46 I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and will leave it to them that seek wisdom, and will not cease to instruct their offspring even to the holy age.

47 See ye that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all that seek out the truth.

These passages to me are the core of wisdom.
May you be blessed and love and be loved on your journey, and may you find the treasure you seek.
