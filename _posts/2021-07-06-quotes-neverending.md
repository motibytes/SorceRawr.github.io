“When you’re trying to create a career as a writer, a little delusional thinking goes a long way.”

“If you write what you yourself sincerely think and feel and are interested in… you will interest other people.”

“The first sign of disintegration — in a writer — is that the writing loses the unique stamp of his/her character, & loses its inner light.”

“A writer loves the dark, loves it, but is always fumbling around in the light.”

“Man has always been half-monster, half-dreamer.”

“Art is long and life is short, and success is very far off.”

"The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed." C. G. Jung
