# Evangelion Insights for Artists and Creatives Article
Neon Genesis Evangelion stands out among any televised media I am aware of because it offers something that nothing else does.

Pure talent and skill is not what interests me about Evangelion. Yes, creator Hideaki Anno is a master of his work, yes, the series is miles beyond
anything else that even somewhat resembles it, but that does not interest me.

What interests me is the author's ambition and intention. We watch media because we expect to be entertained. The intention for
creating media is to create media that others will enjoy. Evangelion wears this entertainment factor as a body, but not as a soul.

The author is focused on self-expression. When most people create, perhaps we could say they are creating to be seen.
They are demonstrating talent and ability. The author of Neon Genesis Evangelion may not care too much about what you think.
He may not care too much about what you like. He didn't create this for you, a pleasant story to follow.
It could be said that any great artist pours themselves into their work, their essence ringing through, but for most of us, we at least
put the best of ourselves into our creations, or at least what we can stand to look at. That is not what the author did.
He went for honesty. He went for truth. He did not seek only to create what is beautiful, he created what was also ugly, what was unpleasant.
Those out there that do this, they understand something.

"Oh, you're, like me." is that understanding.
There is an understanding gained from self-awareness that can allow you to assume that the secret ways that you feel,
that no one else in the world has experienced, is exactly what others have experienced and intimately connects you to them in that shared experience.
[Perhaps the audience does not enjoy being reminded of such feelings because they associate it to being alone.]

Because Hideaki chose to express this anyway, even when his thoughts may have told him that no one else in the world would understand him,
Anno has given me the gift of his hidden experience. He has given me proof that I am not alone in some of my worst experiences of existence and that there
may be more. In this, there is a willingness to freely create, regardless of anyone's opinion.

The series goes beyond even asking others if it is likeable, it does not even ask others if it is understandable. The story of Evangelion is famous for being
incomprehensible. It is for that reason that others judge it, and it is for that reason that puts it in an entirely different class of storytelling from other narrative fiction.

See that this is the same as the author expressing what was unlikable, it is in changing his focus onto not what others understood, but what he understood.
This allowed him to go far deeper into crafting his world. We just happened to be bystanders.

This is not to say that he is not battling with the opinion of another voice as well, the voice of his own critique. Listening to this voice is what causes a person to
create something off of the scale, that nothing else compares to because it was not being compared to the standards of other. The measure it is being weighed against is not the measure of the world. Now, to an artist, unfortunately this often means that their work is never good enough. Our standards are always higher than anyone else's, and
we may never reach our own standards. Still, it is in reaching this high that can allow us to create works that others admire, high above the standards of the competition.

I am not trying to review Evangelion here, I am observing what can be learned here from an artist's perspective. What did the creator choose to do that allowed
Evangelion to become what it is?

What did he not do?

He did not entirely abandon entertainment to go into a story of his inner world. Or, in another sense, he did not betray himself, his own target audience, his own inner teenager that would be interested in mecha robots. This is critical to the series success. He pours his likability, interest factor, skill and talent into the entertainment part of the show, he caters completely to the audience when it comes to action. Give them everything they want.
When you do this, you end up with a production like Neon Genesis Evangelion.

This is a series that will be timeless for this simple formula;
give the majority what they want, while giving you what you want. If you assume that your audience will complain about everything that is unfamiliar to them, or
whatever is uncomfortable, you know your audience. You know what your audience basically truly is, a spoiled brat. It is a brat that will always ask for more,
never be satisfied, and always find a problem with your work. The thing is, especially with a cult niche audience, you and this audience need each other, they want what only you have, and you need them to carry the series into popularity.

So, we should assume the niche genre fanbase will complain. We give them the action and let them complain about the rest of our show.

What is to be seen here is that a show must be likeable. It must be likeable enough to be carried until it can survive on its own reputation.
Evangelion is most likely not a success because of an introspective look into the human condition. It's likely a success because its mecha robots were likable.
However, we know still know about it today because it is again, an introspective psychological drama.

Now, if we remove the self-expressing story, what outcome do we get? A forgettable mecha anime that none of us have ever heard of. It doesn't matter how good it is.
It can be the best mecha anime ever created, and I'll have never heard of it. Suddenly, it's no longer timeless, because this series isn't just a pop culture meme.
In its efforts at human understanding, it holds meaning. This could be called, intrinsic value.

The formula requires both in order for the media to become timeless and self-perpetuate. Once the ship has launched via likability and makes it out of port to the ocean, it now needs a different kind of fuel to survive, it needs something more. The 'more' that Evangelion has is the author's soul he put into it, whether anyone asked him or not.

Now launched, the shows attention can oscillate between the masses interested in the anime genre that will watch **anything**, and the smaller audience on the outskirts that will only watch **something**. I'm probably wrong about that. I don't have the data to determine that.

The important part to remember is that even right now, none of the critics and articles for Evangelion are calling it amazing. They don't call it good.
And yet. We're still watching it. We're watching it because the show has meaning.
