#I'm not more creative than you!

I am not more creative than you! Do not ever believe that I am more creative than you, reader!
There is no difference between me and you, I am not gifted with more creativity than you, you are just as creative.

The difference between me and you is I am arrogant! I am arrogant enough to throw cards on to the table.

It doesn't actually really matter what you think of yourself or who you think you are or who I believe I am.

If you want to be creative, you throw cards out there, and you take action. And your action makes your own nature self-evident!

You must come to believe you are creative by the proof of your own reality, the proof of history, the proof of evidence, the proof that you have created!

You are a creative because you have created!

You are deserving of creating because you have created!

You are entitled and fully qualified to create because you have created!
