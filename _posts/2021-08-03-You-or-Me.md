# I'm not more creative than you!

I am not more creative than you! Do not ever believe that I am more creative than you, reader!
There is no difference between me and you, I am not gifted with more creativity than you, you are just as creative.

The difference between me and you is I am arrogant! I am arrogant enough to throw cards on to the table.

It doesn't actually really matter what you think of yourself or who you think you are or who I believe I am.

If you want to be creative, you throw cards out there, and you take action. And your action makes your own nature self-evident!

You must come to believe you are creative by the proof of <b> reality </b>, the proof of your own history, the proof of physical evidence, the proof that you have created!

You are a creative because you have created!

You are deserving of creating because you have created!

You are entitled and fully qualified to create because you have created!
