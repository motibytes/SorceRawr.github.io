Listen genuinely and others will desperately desire to genuinely hear you.

Yeah this sounds all nice and all but when none of us know how to do this, it doesn't really help much.

Well as it turns out, some people do know how to use this and it's quite the lucrative
skill to have in your arsenal. Add the skills to your life that improve your quality of life and you have
effectively changed your life.

This skill is relatively new. No one person holds every piece to it. The one who can learn this can
take the gold from available sources of information. If you learn this,
you are among the few people in this world to even know that this superpower exists.
