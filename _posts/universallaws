So maybe you're an athiest. You understand what you know, you see what you can decipher and understand.
You've looked at the world and determined, there cannot be a rhyme or reason for any of this shit.
Anything else is a fantasy, delusion, or simply a waste of your time.
And yet, for whatever reason, you can't get what you want out of your life. It seems like there are
external forces determined to fuck you over. As if the system itself has it out for you.
No matter what you do, you cannot gain control over your life.

Or maybe you're curious. You don't know exactly how reality works, but you've seen others are manifesting
their desires, living your dreams, and you know somehow, you could too. You've seen the Law of Attraction
stuff, tried it, seems like wishful thinking and it doesn't seem to work. You've already figured out that
pretty much all of the teachers out there are basically glorified scams, trying to get your time and monies.

Or maybe philosophy just isn't for you. You don't want to figure it all out, you just wanna live your damn
life and be happy.
