"the first and 7th step are bound to eachother
and the alchemist begins where he started
the initial square or cubic stone he began with now having
undergone purification and perfection,
being the greater stone, or the philosophers stone,

and the above and below being brought together.
the alchemist has returned and is now in a
greater state of clarity
