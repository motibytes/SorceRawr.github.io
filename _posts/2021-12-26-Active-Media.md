I wasn't interested in this game when I first saw this, however this game was a refreshing surprise, a highly polished experience that feels like immersive storytelling with well developed characters.
This game really captures the inclusive and tight-bonded team feeling of the Guardians. If you're a fan of Marvel, this is worth your time.
