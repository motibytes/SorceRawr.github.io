Q:
I now know that what I want is creativity.
But I didn't know that's what I wanted before.
It may even have bothered me to see it.
I certainly didn't look for it.

So what word do I use to grab your eye to give you the creativity you don't know you're looking for?
maybe this isn't the focus. this is a side thing.
the focus is that capture of a greater art.

A:
I just sell what's interesting.

What's interesting just happens to be creativity.
