sorcerawr is a growing work of art, with a body and form.
always minimal, quality over content, must be critical.

some posts can hold buckets of data.

future content types:

  blog collection: projects page opens up another "sorcerawr posts box layout", exactly the same as the front page of sorcerawr.com.
  that is, articles are nested in other articles.

  this 'nesting' nature of the site makes the site feel like its delving deeper into itself, like there are secret paths to find.
  at the same time, the same content layout feels familiar..

  sorcerawr will nest and nest and nest..
