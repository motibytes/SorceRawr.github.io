Stage 1.
1. User must be extremely tired, too tired to do anything
2. User must attempt to do something

Stage 2.
1. User must write freehand in order to "channel from outside source"
2. User must attempt to do something
3. Continue until out of energy
4. Repeat stage 1.
5. Repeat stage 2.

User should experience that somehow without sleep they are harnessing more energy than was available before, and even more than that, they are actually 10xing the energy they had before doing anything, turning into a 'battery', for illustrations sake.(edited)
