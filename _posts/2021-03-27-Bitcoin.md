You may have never considered or even fathomed the joy of throwing a few dollars into something and then watching your money violently gain and lose value, but I can tell you this edge of your seat action is possible to take part in right this very moment.

It's kind of like throwing pennies into a wishing well that becomes self aware and starts throwing pennies back at you.

The days of staring at clouds praying for money to fall from the sky are over.

There is simply no better way to reflect and contemplate on the full unrealized potential of your greed and unrealized dreams than while watching your $2 worth of bitcoin multiply in abundance as you are filled with the realizations of why you aren't rich and why it really is all your fault. Bitcoin will change your life!
