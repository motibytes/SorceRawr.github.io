<b> Basic Principles </b>

1. Creativity is the natural order of life. Life is energy: pure creative energy.  <br>

Rules of the Road
In order to be an artist, I must:

1. Show up at the page. Use the page to rest, to dream, to try.
2. Fill the well by caring for my artist.
3. Set small and gentle goals and meet them.
4. Pray for guidance, courage, and humility.
5. Remember it is far harder and more painful to be a blocked artist than it is to do the work.
6. Be alert, always, for the presence of the Great Creator leading and helping my artist.
7. Choose companions who encourage me to do the work, not just talk about doing the work or why I am not doing the work.
8. Remember that the Great Creator loves creativity.
9. Remember that it is my job to do the work, not judge the work.
10. Place this sign in my workplace: Great Creator, I will take care of the quantity.
You take care of the quality.

 Rules to Criticism
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">

1. Receive the criticism all the way through and get it over with.
2. Jot down notes to yourself on what concepts or phrases bother you.
3. Jot down notes on what concepts or phrases seem useful.
4. Do something very nurturing for yourself on what concepts or phrases bother you.
5. Remember that even if you have made a truly rotten piece of art, it may be a necessary stepping-stone to your next work. Art matures spasmodically and requires ugly-duckling growth stages.
6. Look at the criticism again. Does it remind you of any criticism from your past--particularly shaming childhood criticism? Acknowledge to yourself that the current criticism is triggering grief over a long-standing wound.
7. Write a letter to the critic--not to be mailed, most probably. Defend your work and acknowledge what was helpful, if anything, in the criticism proffered.
8. Get back on the horse. Make an immediate commitment to do something creative.
9. Do it. Creativity is the only cure for criticism.

Reading Deprivation Exercise:
"No reading for one week. Without distractions, we are once again thrust into the sensory world.
Casts us into our inner silence. We often cannot hear our own inner voice, the voice of our artist's
inspiration, above the static. Other pollutants poison the well. If we monitor the inflow and keep it to a minimum,
we are rewarded with a new outflow. Our own art, our own thoughts and feelings, will begin to nudge aside the
sludge of blockage until our well is running freely.
For most of us the thought of reading deprivation brings up enormous rage, for most blocked creatives, reading is
an addiction.
