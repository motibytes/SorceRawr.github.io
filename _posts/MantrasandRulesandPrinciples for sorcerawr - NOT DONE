<b> Basic Principles </b>

1. Creativity is the natural order of life. Life is energy: pure creative energy.  <br>
2. There is an underlying, in-dwelling creative force infusing all of life --including ourselves. <br>
3. When we open ourselves to our creativity, we open ourselves to the creator's creativity within us and our lives.  <br>
4. We are, ourselves, creations. And we, in turn, are meant to continue creativity by being creative ourselves.  <br>
5. Creativity is God's gift to us. Using our creativity is our gift back to God.  <br>
6. The refusal to be creative is self-will and is counter to our true nature.  <br>
7. When we open ourselves to exploring our creativity, we open ourselves to God: good orderly direction.  <br>
8. As we open our creative channel to the creator, many gentle but powerful changes are to be expected.  <br>
9. It is safe to open ourselves up to greater and greater creativity.  <br>

Rules of the Road
In order to be an artist, I must:

1. Show up at the page. Use the page to rest, to dream, to try.
2. Fill the well by caring for my artist.
3. Set small and gentle goals and meet them.
4. Pray for guidance, courage, and humility.
5. Remember it is far harder and more painful to be a blocked artist than it is to do the work.
6. Be alert, always, for the presence of the Great Creator leading and helping my artist.
7. Choose companions who encourage me to do the work, not just talk about doing the work or why I am not doing the work.
8. Remember that the Great Creator loves creativity.
9. Remember that it is my job to do the work, not judge the work.
10. Place this sign in my workplace: Great Creator, I will take care of the quantity.
You take care of the quality.


Beliefs + Alternatives <br>
<br>
artists are <br>
drunk - sober <br>
crazy - sane <br>
broke - solvent  <br>
irresponsible - responsible  <br>
loners - user-friendly  <br>
promiscuous - faithful <br>
doomed - saved <br>
unhappy - happy <br>
born, not made - discovered and recovered <br>


 Rules to Criticism
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">

1. Receive the criticism all the way through and get it over with.
2. Jot down notes to yourself on what concepts or phrases bother you.
3. Jot down notes on what concepts or phrases seem useful.
4. Do something very nurturing for yourself on what concepts or phrases bother you.
5. Remember that even if you have made a truly rotten piece of art, it may be a necessary stepping-stone to your next work. Art matures spasmodically and requires ugly-duckling growth stages.
6. Look at the criticism again. Does it remind you of any criticism from your past--particularly shaming childhood criticism? Acknowledge to yourself that the current criticism is triggering grief over a long-standing wound.
7. Write a letter to the critic--not to be mailed, most probably. Defend your work and acknowledge what was helpful, if anything, in the criticism proffered.
8. Get back on the horse. Make an immediate commitment to do something creative.
9. Do it. Creativity is the only cure for criticism.

# Reading Deprivation Exercise:

"No reading for one week. Without distractions, we are once again thrust into the sensory world.
Casts us into our inner silence. We often cannot hear our own inner voice, the voice of our artist's
inspiration, above the static. Other pollutants poison the well. If we monitor the inflow and keep it to a minimum,
we are rewarded with a new outflow. Our own art, our own thoughts and feelings, will begin to nudge aside the
sludge of blockage until our well is running freely.
For most of us the thought of reading deprivation brings up enormous rage, for most blocked creatives, reading is
an addiction.

# Block Blasting

In order to work freely on a project, an artist must be at least functionally free of resentment (anger) and resistance (fear).
That means that any buried barriers must be aired before the work can proceed.
The same holds true for any buried payoffs to not working.
Blocks are seldom mysterious. They are, instead, recognizable artistic defenses against what is perceived (rightly or wrongly) as a hostile environment.

Remember, your artist is a creative child. It sulks, throws tantrums, holds grudges, it is afraid of the dark, the bogeyman, and any adventure that isn't safely scary. As your artist's parent and guardian, its big brother, warrior, and companion, it falls to you to convince your artist it is safe to come out and (work) play.

Questions asked when work becomes difficult or bogs down, usually act to clear the obstructed flow.

1. List any resentments (anger) you have in connection with this project.
It does not matter how petty, picky, or irrational these resentments may appear to your adult self. To your artist child they are real big deals: grudges.
[Some examples: I resent being the second artist asked, not the first. (I am too the best.) I resent the editor, she just nitpicks. She never says anything nice. I resent doing work for this idiot, he never pays me on time.]

2. Ask your artist to list any and all fears about the projected piece of work and/or anyone connected to it. Again, these fears can be as dumb as any two year-old's. It does not matter that they are groundless to your adult's eye. What matters is that they are big scary monsters to your artist.
[Some examples: I'm afraid the work will be rotten and I won't know it... I'm afraid the work will be good and they won't know it.. I'm afraid all my ideas
are hackneyed and outdated... I'm afraid my ideas are ahead of their time...I'm afraid I'll starve...I'm afraid I'll never finish...I'm afraid I'll never start...I'm afraid I will be embarrassed (I'm already embarrassed)...]

3. Ask your self if that is all. Have you left out any itsy fear? Have you suppressed any "stupid" anger? Get it onto the page.

4. Ask yourself what you stand to gain by not doing this piece of work.
[Some examples: If I don't write the piece, no one can hate it...If I don't write the piece, my jerk editor will worry...If I don't paint, sculpt,
act, dance, sing, I can criticize others, knowing I could do better.]

5. Make your deal. The deal is, "Okay, Creative Force, you take care of the quality, I'll take care of the quantity." Sign your deal and post it.


Name Your goal: I am _____ Creating the Blessed Be Loved Bytes that are changing the world and people are loving them and desperate
to collect one for themselves and the entire world and news media is wanting them and wondering what sort of art they could
make and how to have such ideas and all of the people are flooding into my websites and wondering what my secrets are and all of my
secrets and articles are all there for them!

In the present tense, describe yourself doing it at the height of your powers! This is your ideal scene.
Read this aloud to yourself.
Post this above your work area.
Read this aloud, daily!
